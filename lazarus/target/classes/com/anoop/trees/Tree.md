A tree is a data structure composed of nodes.
>  Each tree has a root node. (Actually, this isn't strictly necessary in graph theory,   but it's usually how we use trees in programming, and especially programming interviews.)
>  The root node has zero or more child nodes.
>  Each child node has zero or more child nodes, and so on

Binary Tree:
A binary tree is a tree in which each node has up to two children.

Binary Tree vs. Binary Search Tree:
    A binary search tree is a binary tree in which every node fits a specific ordering property: all left descendents <= n < all right descendents. This must be true for each node n.

Balanced vs. Unbalanced:
Two common types of balanced trees are red-black trees and AVL trees.
